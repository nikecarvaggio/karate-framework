# Petshop API Testing on Karate Framework with Java 16 and Gradle 8.1

This README file provides instructions for setting up and running API tests for a pet shop application using Karate Framework with Java 16 and Gradle 8.1.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 16 or higher
- Gradle 8.1 or higher
- Your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ or Eclipse

## Project Setup

- Unzip the project to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred IDE.

## Running the API Tests

You can run the API tests using Gradle. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to your project directory.

To run the API tests, use the following command:

`gradle clean test`
or
`gradle clean test`

## View Reports

After running the API tests, you can view the test reports generated by Karate. Open the
**/build/karate-reports/karate-summary.html** directory to access the test result files.

That's it! You should now be able to set up and run your API tests for the pet shop application using Karate Framework
with Java 16 and Gradle 8.1.

**Happy testing!**
